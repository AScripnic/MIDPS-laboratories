# Laboratory work number 1

## Task accomplishment

To accomplish these task I've done next steps:

1. Created a new ssh key on my local machine and save it to my github account

4. Opened a new pull request to master branch

During the process of working on tasks above I've met only one problem which is the difference between unix terminal and windows terminal
